This folder contains the Eagle CAD files for the WiFi-USB circuit board.

To install Eagle with a free Express or Educational license, go to
https://cadsoft.io.

It also contains a PDF of the schematic and an image of the board layout
if you donâ€™t want to install Eagle.

    - This cable is reusable for many other kinds of projects.
      It is possible to use an alternative to avoid buying an expensive new
      cable, as long as the Tx and Rx signals are 3.3V. The ESP8266 may get
      fried by 5V signals. However, Vcc goes through the voltage regulator and
      is therefore 5V tolerant.

## Fabrication

I recommend ordering PCBs through [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com).
It only costs about $10 for 3 copies of this board, the quality is good,
and they come in a very regal purple and gold.
There are of course many other options you may prefer, but for newcomers,
OSH Park is recommended.

## Building
